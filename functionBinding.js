// In JavaScript function binding happens using Bind() method. With this method, we can bind an object to a common function, so that the function gives different result when needed. otherwise it gives the same result or gives an error while the code is executing.
// We use the Bind() method to call a function with the this value, this keyword refers to the same object which is currently selected . In other words, bind() method allows us to easily set which object will be bound by the this keyword when a function or method is invoked.
// The need for bind usually occurs, when we use the this keyword in a method and we call that method from a receiver object, then sometimes this is not bound to the object that we expect to be bound to. This results in errors in our program.
